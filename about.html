    <p>Past clients include Valve, Square Enix, Homestuck, Studio Yotta, Brawlhalla, Knight Club.</p>

    <p>In 2015 I graduated from Pratt Institute's Communication Design program.
    During my college years I created merchandise with Valve and ForFansByFans for TF2 and Dota2.
    I then went on to paint backgrounds for animations like OK KO, Eddsworld, Homestuck, and Brawlhalla.</p>

    <p>Recently I've been designing characters for games. I designed monsters, trading cards, and promo art for the upcoming game Holofist. I also created NPC's for another upcoming game, Cornucopia.</p>

    <p>Looking forward to the next adventure!</p></a>
